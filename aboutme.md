Welcome! I'm an undergraduate student at Florida State University studying political science and statistics. 

My research focuses on public opinion, survey methodology, and voting behavior, and has appeared in the [Election Law Journal](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2022.0064) and the [MIT Election Lab Blog](https://electionlab.mit.edu/author/678). I' also a contributor at [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/people/eli.mckown-dawson), where I design public opinion polls and write articles on American politics and survey methods.
