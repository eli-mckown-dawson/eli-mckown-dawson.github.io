Welcome! I'm an undergraduate student at **Florida State University** studying political science and statistics. 

I primarily research **public opinion**, **survey methodology**, and **voting behavior**. My recent work focuses on how election laws (such as voter identification requirements) affect voter confidence, and how data from voter registration files can be used for survey sampling and weighting. 

My research has appeared in the [Election Law Journal](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2022.0064) and the [MIT Election Lab Blog](https://electionlab.mit.edu/author/678). I'm also a contributor at [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/people/eli.mckown-dawson), where I design public opinion polls and write articles on American politics and survey methods. 

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emckowndawson) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eli-mckown-dawson). I'm also on [Github](https://github.com/eli-mckown-dawson), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-stdPpQAAAAJ&hl=en), and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4209-6963).
