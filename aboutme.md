Welcome! I'm an undergraduate student at Florida State University studying political science and statistics. 

My research focuses on public opinion, survey methodology, and voting behavior, and has appeared in the [Election Law Journal](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2022.0064) and the [MIT Election Lab Blog](https://electionlab.mit.edu/author/678). I'm also a contributor at [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/people/eli.mckown-dawson), where I design public opinion polls and write articles on American politics and survey methods. 

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emckowndawson) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eli-mckown-dawson). I'm also on [Github](https://github.com/eli-mckown-dawson), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-stdPpQAAAAJ&hl=en), and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4209-6963).
