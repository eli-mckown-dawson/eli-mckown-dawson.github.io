#### [Unlicensed to bill](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002lc55) – *BBC Radio 5*, October 2025 
- Interviewed by Matt Chorley about air conditioning in the UK, and my article on the subject for Silver Bulletin.

#### [Senate Rating Change: Maine Moves from Leans Republican to Toss-up](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/senate-rating-change-maine-moves-from-leans-republican-to-toss-up/) – *Sabato's Crystal Ball*, October 2025 
- Overall, there are reasonable rejoinders to our reasoning for making Maine’s Senate race a Toss-up. But we do think there is enough question about this race to make it a Toss-up, even as this is still a somewhat vexing race to assess: Eli McKown-Dawson of Nate Silver’s Silver Bulletin had an excellent assessment of the contradictory indicators in the race last month.

#### [Polls Show Another Downward Lurch in Trump Approval Ratings](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/polls-show-another-downward-lurch-in-trump-approval-ratings.html) – *New York Magazine*, April 2025 
- But the most recent polls showed another downward lurch, as Nate Silver’s “Silver Bulletin observed on April 25: "After a string of bad polls — most recently from NYT/Siena — Donald Trump’s net approval rating in the Silver Bulletin average dropped from -5.1 at the start of the week to -7.8 today. He’s still doing better than he was at this point during his first term —Trump sat at a net approval rating of -9.2 back then. But that might not be true for much longer."

#### [Trump’s Approval Rating Keeps Getting Worse](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-approval-rating-keeps-getting-worse.html) – *New York Magazine*, April 2025 
- The initial signs are not good, as Silver Bulletin reported earlier this week: "We’ve had three entirely post-Liberation Day polls. None of them are good for Donald Trump. In today’s new Navigator Research poll, 44 percent of registered voters approve of Trump and 53 percent disapprove. And the latest Morning Consult poll showed Trump with a net approval of -6. Even Rasmussen’s daily tracking poll — where Trump has gotten some of the most positive approval numbers of his second term — has him 4 points underwater."

#### [London Playbook PM: Almost Don roaming](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/london-playbook-pm-almost-don-roaming/) – *Politico*, January 2025 
- WHAT I’VE BEEN READING: A detailed piece from Eli McKown-Dawson on the famous Nate Silver blog about how U.S. pollsters are dealing with being wrong again about the recent election results. It’s useful reading for Westminster too — not that we’ll ever learn.

#### [Is Florida in play? Or is it fool’s gold for Democrats?](https://nypost.com/2024/10/04/us-news/is-florida-in-play-or-is-it-fools-gold-for-democrats/) – *New York Post*, October 2024
- One of polling guru Nate Silver’s lieutenants, Eli McKown-Dawson, argues that’s potentially the case, saying their “model thinks Florida is the 7th-likeliest tipping point state — ahead of states like Nevada where the race is much more even but the number of electoral votes up for grabs is smaller.”
