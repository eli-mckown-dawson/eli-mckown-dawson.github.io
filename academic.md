#### Selected Working Papers

**Using Voter Registration Files to Sample and Contact Voters: Methods and Weighting (with Lonna Atkeson, Austin Cutler, Yimeng Li, and Kenneth Mackie) <br/>**

After the 2022 election, we used the Florida Voter File as a sample frame to sample Florida voters with an interest in understanding voters’ experiences with the election process, including their voter confidence.  Because we did not know who voted and wanted to minimize costs, we took a convenience sample of likely voters, stratified by county, and matched those voters to a set of likely voters with emails. We then over sampled voters with emails who were in small counties, and members of racial and ethnic minority groups, and sampled all the voters in one county.  We tested our sample and the 2022 CES Florida sample using three different weighting schemes: raking, MRP, and sample matching to a postelection random sample of 2000 voters to create a representative sample.  In this paper, we explore, compare, and discuss the performance of the different weighting schemes in each sample against known benchmarks, especially gubernatorial vote, choice and to each other.  

**The Role of Geography and Social Networks in Understanding Voting Behavior and Policy Preferences (with Lonna Atkeson) <br/>**

America’s political environment has become increasingly nationalized and affectively polarized. Both findings support the implication that local political context has become less important, with relatively homogenous groups of Democrats and Republicans behaving similarly across the country. I challenge this assumption and show that local political conditions moderate the association between party identification, voting behavior, and policy positions. I hypothesize that location influences these behaviors and attitudes through place-based differences in the partisan makeup of Americans’ social networks. Living and interacting with those who support a particular political party should nudge Americans to support candidates and issues supported by that party. I utilize Cooperative Election Study data from 2006 to 2022 to assess whether the partisan makeup of respondents’ counties, measured as the average difference between county-level Democratic and Republican vote share in the previous three presidential elections, is associated with behavioral or attitudinal differences among co-partisans. I find significant differences in Americans’ political behavior and policy preferences based on local party support in their counties. Holding individual-level party identification constant, Americans in Democratic counties are more likely to support Democratic policy positions, and Americans in Republican counties are more likely to support Republican policy positions. These effects are strongest among independents and “weak” partisans, while “strong” and “leaning” partisans are less likely to be impacted by place. My findings shed light on how communities and social networks influence political behavior and have implications for the accuracy of public opinion surveys.

**The Relationship between the Cost of Voting and Voter Confidence, Beliefs about Fraud, and Voter Intimidation (with Lonna Atkeson, M.V. Hood III, and Robert Stein) <br/>**

We revisit the effect of ballot access laws on voter confidence in the outcome of elections.  Previous research found weak or no relationship between voter confidence and election laws regulating ballot access.  We believe this non-finding is conditioned by partisanship.  Democrats and Republicans view election laws through a partisan lens.  Democrats see these laws as suppressing ballot access while Republicans view election laws as a means of securing the vote. We find strong support for our conditional partisan explanation for the effect of state election laws on voter confidence.  Democrats’ confidence that ballots in their state are counted accurately is lower in states with restrictive ballot access laws.  Republicans’ confidence is greater in states with restrictive access laws.  We further find that in states where ballot access is costly, voter confidence among partisans and supporters of the losing Presidential candidate is significantly higher for Republicans and significantly lower for Democrats than their counterparts in states with less costly ballot access laws.


**The Impact of Voter Confusion in Ranked Choice Voting (with Lonna Atkeson, Kyle Saunders, and Jack Santucci) <br/>**

Election observers have expressed concerns about voter “confusion” under ranked choice voting (RCV) since the 1890s. What is the meaning of “confusing,” and how does it affect behavior? We argue (with much of the literature) that ranking candidates to public office is a complex task. Then we use exit-poll data from a recent rollout in Santa Fe, New Mexico to explore some observable implications of this perspective. Nearly 20% of voters report having felt confused and Hispanics were more likely to be confused than Whites. Confused voters report ranking fewer candidates, lower confidence in ballot-counting accuracy, and lower RCV support. RCV thus raises questions about equity, ease of administration, and its own longevity. Whether voter (or candidate) education can address these is an open question.
