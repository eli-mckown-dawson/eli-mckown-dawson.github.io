Welcome! I'm the Elections Analyst at [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/), where I apply statistics to analyze political data, create polling averages and election forecasts, and write about politics, data, and public opinion. I worked extensively on the [2024 Silver Bulletin election forecast](https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model) and the pubication's coverage of the 2024 U.S. election. And more recently on our pollster ratings and presidential approval polling averages.

I'm also getting my master's degree in statistics from The London School of Economics and Political Science. My main areas of study are survey methodology and applications of statistics in the social sciences. My dissertation explores control question selection in the [item count method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmatched_count).

I primarily cover politics and policy from a data-driven perspective. In the past, I've designed public opinion polls, written articles on American public opinion, and covered the 2022 U.S. election for [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/people/eli.mckown-dawson). I graduated with my B.S. in political science from Florida State University. My academic research on survey methodology, American voting behavior, and public opinion has appeared the [Election Law Journal](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2022.0064), [Social Science Quarterly]( https://doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.13366), and the [MIT Election Lab Blog](https://electionlab.mit.edu/author/678). 

I'm most active on [Substack](https://substack.com/@emckowndawson), [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/emckowndawson), and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eli-mckown-dawson).
