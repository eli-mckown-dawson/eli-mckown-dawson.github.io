I specialize in applying statistical modeling and survey methodology to analyze political data, cover politics and policy from a data-driven perspective, create election forecasts, and design public opinion surveys.

As the Elections Analyst at the [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/), I develop polling averages, election forecasts, and data-driven political analysis. I played a key role in building the [Silver Bulletinâ€™s 2024 U.S. presidential election forecast](https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model), contributing to polling-based election modeling and coverage. My more recent work for the Silver Bulletin includes updating our pollster ratings and launching our presidential approval polling averages.

Previously, at [YouGov America](https://today.yougov.com/people/eli.mckown-dawson), I wrote questions for public opinion polls and designed survey questionnaires, conducted quantitative analysis of voting behavior, and wrote data-driven articles on politics, culture, and the 2022 U.S. election. 

My academic research focuses on survey methodology, voting behavior, and applications of statistics in the social sciences. My work has been published in [The Election Law Journal](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2022.0064), [Social Science Quarterly]( https://doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.13366), and [Political Research Quarterly](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10659129241283169). I am currently completing my MSc in Statistics at the [The London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics), where my dissertation examines question design strategies for [sensitive survey topics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmatched_count).

I'm most active on [Substack](https://substack.com/@emckowndawson), [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/emckowndawson), and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eli-mckown-dawson).
