Welcome! I'm the Assistant Elections Analyst at [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/), where I work on forecasting the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. I'm also an incoming MSc student at **The London School of Economics and Political Science** studying social statistics. 

I primarily research survey methodology, voting behavior, and public opinion. I also design public opinion polls and write articles on American public opinion for [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/people/eli.mckown-dawson). I graduated with my B.S. in political science from Florida State University in 2024. My academic research has appeared the [Election Law Journal](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2022.0064), [Social Science Quarterly]( https://doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.13366), and the [MIT Election Lab Blog](https://electionlab.mit.edu/author/678). 

I'm most active on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/emckowndawson) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eli-mckown-dawson). You can also see more information about my work on [Github](https://github.com/eli-mckown-dawson), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-stdPpQAAAAJ&hl=en).
