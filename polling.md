I ran the Silver Bulletin's 2024 forecast for the U.S. presidential election with Nate Silver. [The model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/) combines public opinion polls with demographic and economic data to simulate thousands of potential election outcomes and forecast the winner of the Electoral College. I designed the charts for our polling average and forecast, maintained our database of public opinion polls, and created a fully automated system for updating our charts with new data. Our forecast was one of the most accurate in 2024 and [exactly predicted the most likely election map](https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-model-exactly-predicted-the-most).


I'm also a contributor at YouGov, where I write articles on American public opinon, design surveys, and create online survey methodology resources. You can find my page on YouGov's website [here.](https://today.yougov.com/people/eli.mckown-dawson) Below are excerpts from some of my most recent articles. 

#### [How question style can influence survey responses: the effect of multiple-select](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/46070-poll-methodology-question-affect-survey-response)

"As with the experience and identity questions, Americans shown each drink in a separate question were more likely to say they had tried them than were Americans who were shown all 12 drinks in the same multiple-select question. For example, Americans in the single-select group (84%) were 10 percentage points more likely than those in the multiple-select group (74%) to say they had ever tried wine. There were similar differences in the estimates of adults who have tried drinks derived from single-select and multiple-select questions for beer (80% vs. 72%), liquor (80% vs. 69%), and champagne (76% vs. 64%)."

#### [Americansâ€™ opinions on state preemption of local laws are driven by partisanship](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/45802-federal-state-local-laws-preemption-poll-partisan)

"However, both Democrats and Republicans think that the other party preempts local laws more often than they think their own party does. For example, 64% of Democrats believe that Republican state governments preempt Democratic local governments very or somewhat often, while only 32% of Republicans think the same. Similarly, only 37% of Democrats think Democratic state governments often preempt Republican local governments, compared to 67% of Republicans."
